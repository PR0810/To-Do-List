# To-Do-List
A Simple To-Do List web app built with HTML,CSS and Javascript. It allows users to add, delete and mark tasks as completed
# 🔗 Blockchain To-Do List

A decentralized task management application built on blockchain technology. Every task operation is recorded as an immutable transaction on a custom blockchain with proof-of-work mining.

## 🌟 Features

### ⛓️ **Blockchain Technology**
- **Immutable Records**: All tasks are stored as blockchain transactions that cannot be altered
- **Proof-of-Work Mining**: Each task operation requires computational work to mine a new block
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full transaction history with timestamps and block metadata
- **Decentralized Storage**: No central database - all data lives on the blockchain

### 📋 **Task Management**
- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with title, description, and priority levels
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed (recorded as blockchain transaction)
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks (permanently recorded on blockchain)
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High priority classification
- **Status Tracking**: Pending and Completed task states

### 🎨 **Modern Interface**
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Contemporary UI with translucent elements and backdrop blur
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live dashboard showing task counts and blockchain metrics
- **Mining Animations**: Visual feedback during block mining operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error message system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- No server setup required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-todo-list.git
   cd blockchain-todo-list
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**
   ```bash
   # Simply open the HTML file in your browser
   open index.html
   # or
   double-click index.html
   ```

3. **Start Using**
   - The application initializes with a genesis block
   - Create your first task and watch it get mined to the blockchain!

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating Tasks
1. Fill in the **Task Title** (required)
2. Add an optional **Description**
3. Select **Priority** level (Low, Medium, High)
4. Click **"⛏️ Mine Task to Blockchain"**
5. Wait for the mining process to complete

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete**: Click the ✅ button to mark tasks as completed
- **Delete**: Click the 🗑️ button to remove tasks (requires confirmation)
- All actions are permanently recorded on the blockchain

### Viewing Blockchain Data
Each task displays:
- **Block Number**: Which block contains the task transaction
- **Block Hash**: Cryptographic hash of the containing block
- **Timestamps**: Creation and completion times
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Blockchain Implementation
```javascript
class Block {
    constructor(index, transactions, previousHash) {
        this.index = index;
        this.timestamp = Date.now();
        this.transactions = transactions;
        this.previousHash = previousHash;
        this.nonce = 0;
        this.hash = this.calculateHash();
    }
}
```

### Transaction Types
- **`create_task`**: New task creation
- **`complete_task`**: Task completion
- **`delete_task`**: Task deletion
- **`genesis`**: Initial blockchain block

### Mining Process
1. Transaction is added to pending pool
2. New block is created with pending transactions
3. Proof-of-work algorithm finds valid hash
4. Block is added to chain
5. UI updates with new blockchain state

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Blockchain Features
- **Difficulty**: Adjustable proof-of-work difficulty (default: 2)
- **Hash Algorithm**: Custom implementation for educational purposes
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, nonce
- **Chain Validation**: Each block references previous block's hash

### Storage & Persistence
- **Client-Side Only**: All data stored in browser memory
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- **Session-Based**: Data resets on page reload (educational blockchain)

### Security Considerations
- **Immutable History**: Tasks cannot be secretly modified
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Block integrity verification
- **Proof-of-Work**: Prevents easy blockchain manipulation
- **Transaction Ordering**: Chronological operation history

## 📊 Statistics Dashboard

The app provides real-time metrics:
- **Total Tasks**: Complete count of all tasks
- **Pending Tasks**: Active tasks awaiting completion
- **Completed Tasks**: Successfully finished tasks
- **Block Height**: Current blockchain length

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Elements
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern color schemes
- **Hover Animations**: Interactive element responses
- **Loading States**: Mining progress indicators
- **Status Badges**: Visual task state indicators

### Responsive Design
- **Grid Layouts**: Adaptive to different screen sizes
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch-optimized interface
- **Accessible Colors**: High contrast for readability

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: Multi-user blockchain synchronization
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated task workflows
- **Token Rewards**: Incentivize task completion
- **Export/Import**: Blockchain data portability
- **Advanced Analytics**: Task performance metrics

### Technical Improvements
- **Persistent Storage**: Local storage or IndexedDB integration
- **Merkle Trees**: Enhanced blockchain verification
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Beyond proof-of-work
- **API Integration**: External service connections
